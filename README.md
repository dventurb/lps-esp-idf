# ESP-IDF library for Pololu LPS sensors

ESP-IDF library for Pololu LPS25H, LPS331AP and LPS22DF boards.
This repository contains a fork of the original [Pololu LPS Arduino library](https://github.com/pololu/lps-arduino/tree/master), adapted in C and for use with the **ESP-IDF** for ESP32.

### Tested 
- ESP32 DevKit (SDA: IO21, SCL: IO22)
